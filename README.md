FINDING ITEMS IN YOUR WAREHOUSE HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER

THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ASSOCIATE OBJECTS WITH SECTORS IN A WAY TO FIND THEM EASILY. FOR EXAMPLE IN SECTOR ONE (WHICH PHYSICALLY WILL BE MARKED WITH A LETTER) WE WILL HAVE CLEANERS AND SO ON.

THERE ARE TWO FILES. MAIN.C IS IN ENGLISH. MAIN. C IS IN ITALIAN.

TO FILL IN THE CODE I HAVE USED GCC.
EXAMPLE: (1) gcc main.c -o main
         (2) ./main

operating system used: Debian GNU / Linux

NOTE: SOME VARIABLES ARE IN ITALIAN LANGUAGES. SOME ENGLISH WORDS MAY BE WRONG. hope it can be clear
